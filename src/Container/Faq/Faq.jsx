              No. This one-time purchase offers you lifetime updates at no extra
              cost. You can choose to purchase a support extension after the
              initial six months of support has expired â€“ however, this is
              entirely optional. There are no recurring fees to continue using
              our themes.

              Pro (premium plugin, included for free).
